# TNSIF Java Training Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java projects and assignments developed during the TNSIF Java training program. It covers fundamental concepts, advanced features like Streams and Generics, and real-world case studies.

## Project Structure

### 1. Core Java Concepts (/src)

Demonstrations of fundamental Java features:

* **Arrays**: Basic array operations and sorting activities.
* **Collections**: Usage of various data structures including ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, HashSet, TreeSet, and PriorityQueue.
* **Generics**: Implementation of generic classes and methods for type-safe programming.
* **Multithreading**: Examples of creating threads using both the Thread class and the Runnable interface, including thread synchronization with join().
* **Lambda Expressions**: Functional interfaces and their implementations using Lambda expressions.
* **Stream API**: Data processing using functional-style operations like map, filter, and collect.

### 2. Employee Assignment (/EmployeeAssignment)

A standalone project demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:

* **Inheritance**: A base Employee class extended by specialized Manager and Developer classes.
* **Polymorphism and Utilities**: An EmployeeUtilities class that handles generic employee objects to print details and calculate salary raises.

### 3. GoShopping App Case Study (/CaseStudyOne)

An implementation of the Factory Design Pattern for a shopping application:

* **Framework**: Abstract classes (ShopFactory, ShopAcc, PrimeAcc, NormalAcc) defining the application logic.
* **Application**: Concrete implementations (GSShopFactory, GSPrimeAcc, GSNormalAcc) that provide specific business logic for different account types.
